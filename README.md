# GoggleMaps

**GoggleMaps** is a lightweight map replacement addon for vanilla **World of Warcraft 1.12.1**.
It brings a Google Maps‚Äìstyle experience to Azeroth, with zooming, dragging, and optional quest integration.

Unlike heavier addons (such as Carbonite), GoggleMaps is designed to stay minimal, fast, and easy to use.

Want to use this with TurtleWoW? You can use [GoggleMaps-Turtle](https://github.com/spawnedc/goggle-maps-turtle) alongside GoggleMaps.
