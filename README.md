# GoggleMaps

**GoggleMaps** is a lightweight map replacement addon for vanilla **World of Warcraft 1.12.1**.
It brings a Google Maps‚Äìstyle experience to Azeroth, with zooming, dragging, and optional quest integration.

Unlike heavier addons (such as Carbonite), GoggleMaps is designed to stay minimal, fast, and easy to use.

Want to use this with TurtleWoW? You can use [GoggleMaps-Turtle](https://github.com/spawnedc/goggle-maps-turtle) alongside GoggleMaps.

## üõ†Ô∏è A Little Backstory

This all began out of curiosity. I‚Äôve always loved **Carbonite** for its mapping features, and when I stumbled upon the [Carbonite Vanilla backport](https://gitlab.com/knights-of-sunwell/carbonite-vanilla) by Ritual, I decided to dive in and see how it worked under the hood.

I spent some time reverse engineering the backport, exploring how it handled maps, overlays, and zooming. It felt like opening a little puzzle box from Vanilla WoW‚Äôs past.

From that exploration, I rewrote everything from scratch to create **Goggle Maps**: a lightweight, mapping-only addon for Vanilla and Turtle WoW. The goal was simple: fast, clean, and functional maps, with optional integration for addons like pfQuest and support for Turtle‚Äôs custom zones.

To make this possible, I also built a **toolkit** that automates the heavy lifting: extracting data from MPQ files, parsing DBCs, and generating the datasets that drive Goggle Maps. You can check it out here: [Goggle Maps Tools](https://github.com/spawnedc/goggle-maps-tools/). Just because I wrote too much Lua, I switched to my main language of choice: Javascript.

So while Carbonite inspired the journey, every line of **Goggle Maps** code is original.
